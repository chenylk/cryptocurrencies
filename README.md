# cryptocurrencies

## Summary
  * For this project I analyzed cryptocurrencies by clustering a vast amount of coins into groups. These groups were determined by machine learning unsupervised models. The data was cleaned up by dropping unnecessary columns to build the model. Then dummy variables were applied to the categorical variables.I standardized the data, and used PCA to reduce the dimensions to three principal components. I created a new data frame from these dimensions. An elbow curve was used to determine the best value for K, 4, in the KMeans model. The different cryptocurrencies were plotted with each coin belonging to one of four classes. Most coins were centered around a similar ratio of total coins supplied and total coins mined.
